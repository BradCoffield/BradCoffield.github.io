    <p>
        Hi there. <br>I'm a librarian and web developer from Billings, MT. </p>

<div id="about-content">
    
        <p>I'm married with two children and love spending time with my family, writing fiction, exercising, coding, and not gardening</p>
       
        <p>I worked for Saint Francis University Library from 2006 to 2018 and now I work for Rocky Mountain College. My job's a lot of fun, and I do a variety of things: reference, instruction, collection development, and web development.</p>

        <p>My priorities as a librarian are always student-centered. How can we serve the students best? How can we guide them and support them as researchers and as informed citizens? Some of the most satisfying work comes when I can help students one-on-one with difficult research projects and see them leave newly elated and confident with research in hand and the tools to take it further.</p>
