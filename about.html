        Hi there. <br>I'm a librarian and web developer from Billings, MT. </p>
        <!-- <img src='https://placehold.it/350x450?text=hey' alt='' /> -->

<div id="about-content">
    
     
        <p>I worked for Saint Francis University Library from 2006 to 2018 and now I work for Rocky Mountain College. My job's a lot of fun, and I do a variety of things: reference, instruction, collection development, and web development.</p>

        <p>I love to make websites and work with code. Please take a moment to check out my work on <a href="https://www.rocky.edu/library">library sites</a>, <a href="http://www.ashleykunsa.com">personal webpages</a>, and <a href="http://www.wpwvcacrl.org">non-profits</a>. </p>  
        <p>One of the reasons I love being a librarian is because of how much I enjoy helping people. I bring that same passion to my web work. If you're someone looking for a new website (or an update to an existing one) for yourself, your small-business, non-profit, or church, let me know. My freelance rates are reasonable and if you represent a small organization without many resources I'm also interested in donating my services. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact.html">Get in touch!</a></p>
